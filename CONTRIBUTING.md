## ðŸ›  Development Workflow

We use **GitFlow** for branching:

- **main** â†’ Production-ready code  
- **develop** â†’ Integration branch (all features and fixes merge here first)  
- **feature/** â†’ For new features (e.g., `feature/signup-form`)  
- **hotfix/** â†’ For urgent fixes to production (e.g., `hotfix/login-crash`)  

### Example
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
````

## âœ… Commit Messages

Follow a consistent format. We recommend **Conventional Commits**:

* `feat:` for new features
* `fix:` for bug fixes
* `chore:` for maintenance tasks
* `docs:` for documentation updates

Example:

```
feat: add signup form with email validation
```
